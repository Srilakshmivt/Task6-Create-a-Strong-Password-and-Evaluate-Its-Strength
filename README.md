# Task6-Create-a-Strong-Password-and-Evaluate-Its-Strength
: Understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools.
- Learn the components of strong passwords.
- Test and compare different passwords using online strength tools.
- Summarize the common threats and how complexity defends against them.

  **Password Creation & Evaluation**
1. **Generate multiple passwords** with increasing complexity:
   - Vary length.
   - Use uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
2. **Evaluate each password** using tools like PasswordMeter, Bitwarden, NordPass, etc.
3. **Record scores and feedback** (e.g., crack time, entropy estimation).
4. **Document observations** on typical weaknesses and areas of improvement.

**Tools Used**
- **PasswordMeter** – Simple scoring and breakdown of password features https://passwordmeter.com/

**- Key Findings & Best Practices**

Length beats complexity: Longer passwords exponentially increase required guesses—even a single extra character dramatically raises resistance .

Length recommendations: Aim for at least 12 characters, preferably 13–16 or more for stronger security .
